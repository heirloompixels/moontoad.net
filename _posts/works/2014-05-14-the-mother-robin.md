It's really dusty in my studio: the spring winds.<br>
The robin it's herald.<br>
The Mother Robin. 

It's my last day with her. 

She thieves the worms i work so hard to provide a comfortable life to in my garden. I don't mind in particular - gotta feed the young ones. 

Soon to be one. <br>
Soon to be none.

I particularly like the way robins run on the ground. The efficiency of their postured elegance astounds my aesthetic mind. Head down, back straight and run run run stop. Look. Worm. Back to the nest around and round-to know such perfection of task is to know solar nuclear reactions.

O.K. <br>
Fledgling. <br>
Hop about clumsy fuzz. 

There is like a week of uber vulnerability. Incrediable luck -  the little one has a voice and the tenacity to remain silent until spoken to - mom's solitary geeek! <br>
Piercing. <br>
Effective. <br>

The return answer  (Sweet from a fresh beak)

Apt as he might be in maternal conversation the little one wanders, longing for the promised adventure just out of sight around the next bush/tree/weed/fence/deck/shoe. 

(and believe me, i know this longing)

If only the baby would stay put she thinks. Quick jaunt to another perch. Geeek. The fuzz responds. Warily the hop to the ground. (I must wonder the number of words birds have for the different flights they do. Must far surpass the eskimo snow vocabulary)

Lunch.
Dinner.
Breakfast.
Snacks.
More snacks.
A little more snack.
Days, nights and geeekity geeeks.

I try to help and chase the cats and shoo the nomad from the street. One night he was asleep in the street. I do my best (awkward human).

Now sunrise - the first geeek of the day. The beak friendly breakfast. Snacks. Morning routines. All is well. 

Geeek. Geeek. <br>
And then Geeek.

No answer. Again. No answer. The search continues.<br> 
Geeek. <br>
Swoop - dash - run Geeek.<br> 
Geeek. <br>
Further afield; Now closer again. Frantic. Geeek, geeek geeekin.

The pace slows. The search slows. A quiet understating of the hours sans food. Food the source of water. Hours sans water. Optimistic hope lingers. For days geeek. geeek. geeek.

Natural reality: until next year we fly afield the nomads of the sky.
