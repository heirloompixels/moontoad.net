The backpack on the left has been my companion for the last 15 or so years.  It's old and worn out now and gets to be retired for the remainder of my time with it.  The backpack is a Dana Design from Bozeman Montana. It was a prototype and features a cool leather logo.  It's stunningly beautiful.  I'm so sad to hang it up but i'll take out out now and again to let it taste the sweat freedom of the hills once in a while. 

On the right is a brand new backpack.  It's lighter and almost as comfortable as the Dana Design.  This backpack is a [3400 Porter](http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/packs/3400-porter-pack.html) pack made by Hyperlite Mountain Gear.  It's sexy, comfortable and carries well.

So here's to the changing of the guard.
